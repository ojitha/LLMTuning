        "\n",
        "Language Models use statistical methods to predict the succession of following tokens in a text sequence. Generative Al is a technique that uses neural networks to generate next words in a sequence\n",
        "\n",
        "The conditional probability eauation:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### N-grams and LLM Tokenizers\n",
        "\n",
        "An **n-gram** is a contiguous sequence of n items from a text or speech sample. In the context of LLMs and tokenizers, these \"items\" are typically characters or bytes.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How N-grams Relate to Tokenization\n",
        "\n",
        "Modern LLM tokenizers like **BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)** and **WordPiece** are fundamentally based on n-gram principles:\n",
        "\n",
        "Character-Level N-grams\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Unigram (1-gram)**: Single characters → `\"h\"`, `\"e\"`, `\"l\"`, `\"l\"`, `\"o\"`\n",
        "- **Bigram (2-gram)**: Character pairs → `\"he\"`, `\"el\"`, `\"ll\"`, `\"lo\"`\n",
        "- **Trigram (3-gram)**: Character triples → `\"hel\"`, `\"ell\"`, `\"llo\"`\n",
        "\n",
        "How Tokenizers Use This\n",
        "\n",
        "**BPE[^3] (used by GPT models):**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Starts with individual characters (unigrams)\n",
        "2. Iteratively merges the most frequent adjacent pairs\n",
        "3. Builds a vocabulary of increasingly longer n-grams\n",
        "4. Example: `\"hello\"` might become `[\"he\", \"llo\"]` or `[\"hello\"]` depending on frequency\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key insight**: The tokenizer learns which n-grams appear most frequently in training data and treats them as single tokens. Common words become single tokens, while rare words get split into subword n-grams.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why This Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Efficiency**: Frequent n-grams (like \"the\", \"ing\") become single tokens\n",
        "- **Flexibility**: Rare words decompose into known subword n-grams\n",
        "- **Vocabulary size**: Balances between character-level (too many tokens per word) and word-level (vocabulary too large)\n",
        "\n",
        "The vocabulary of modern tokenizers is essentially a learned dictionary of the most useful n-grams from 1 up to some maximum length (often whole words). In the prompt, the input text is break into tokens. Tokens are converted into a vector (word embeddings) of that model.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Encoder processes (understand) tokens\n",
        "    - Auto-encoder models (BERT, etc.)\n",
        "- Decoder generates tokens\n",

        "\n",
        "> When you say parameters in the LLM, tha mean weights.\n",
        "{:.info-box}\n",
        "\n",
        "In a Feed Forward Network(FNN), the Weights are multiplied by the incoming values, then summed up and passed to an activation function (ReLU): $$f\\left( \\sum w_{i}x_{i}+b\\right) $$\n",
        "\n",
        "### Positional Encoding in Transformers\n",
        "\n",
        "The position of the word of the sequence is maintained by Positional encoding in the parallel process in the encoder. Positional encoding is a technique that allows Transformers to understand the **order** of tokens in a sequence, since the attention mechanism itself is position-agnostic. The offsets must be really small, to ensure the semantic representation of the token doesn't change. Unlike RNNs that process tokens sequentially, *Transformers process all tokens in parallel*. Without positional encoding, the sentence \"The cat chased the mouse\" would be identical to \"The mouse chased the cat\" to the model. Many newer models (like GPT-3, GPT-4) use **learned positional embeddings** instead, which are trained alongside the model rather than using fixed sinusoids.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Self-attention\n",
        "\n",
        "Self-attention is the core mechanism that allows Transformers to understand relationships between all words in a sentence simultaneously. Unlike reading sequentially, self-attention lets each word \"look at\" every other word and decide which ones are most relevant to understanding its meaning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it works: For each word, the model creates three vectors called **Query** (Q), **Key** (K), and **Value** (V).\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Query** Vector: Q is a set of \"questions\" that each token asks about each other token.\n",
        "- **Key** Vector: the K vector helps determine the importance of each part of the input relative to the query.\n",
        "- **Value** Vector: The V (value) vector represents the actual data or information to be attended.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like a search system - the Query is \"what am I looking for?\", the Key is \"what do I contain?\", and the Value is \"what information do I offer?\". When processing a word, its Query vector is compared against the Key vectors of all other words (including itself) through a dot product operation. This comparison produces attention scores that indicate how much focus should be placed on each word. These scores are then normalized using **softmax** to create **attention weights** that sum to 1.0. Finally, these weights are used to create a weighted sum of all the Value vectors, producing a context-aware representation of the original word.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The goal of the attention mechanism is to add contextual information to an input sequence\n",
        "{:.green}\n",
        "\n",
        "The beauty of self-attention is in its ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships. In the sentence \"The animal didn't cross the street because it was too tired,\" self-attention helps the model understand that \"it\" refers to \"animal\" rather than \"street\" by computing high attention weights between these tokens. The mechanism runs in parallel for all positions, making it highly efficient. Modern Transformers use **multi-head attention**, which means running multiple self-attention operations simultaneously with different learned weight matrices, allowing the model to attend to different types of relationships - one head might focus on syntactic structure, another on semantic meaning, and yet another on coreference resolution.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Check the GPU utilisation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ojitha/blog/master/assets/images/2025-07-23-LLMonAWS/self_attention_sketch.svg)\n",
        "\n",
        "Positional encodings are vectors **added** to the token embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Feed Forward Network (FFN) in Transformers\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Feed Forward Network (FFN)** is a crucial component that comes after the attention mechanism in each Transformer layer. While self-attention helps tokens communicate and share information with each other, the FFN processes each token's representation independently to capture complex, non-linear patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### How FFN Works\n",
        "\n",
        "The FFN is applied to each position separately and identically, consisting of two linear transformations with a non-linear activation (ReLU or GELU) in between. The architecture follows a specific pattern: it first **expands** the dimensionality by a factor of 4 (sometimes 2 or 8 depending on the model), applies the non-linear activation, then **compresses** back down to the original embedding size.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, in GPT-3 with a model dimension of 12,288, the FFN expands to 49,152 dimensions (4x) in the hidden layer, applies ReLU activation to introduce non-linearity, then projects back down to 12,288 dimensions. This expansion-compression pattern is sometimes called a \"bottleneck\" architecture, though here the \"bottleneck\" is actually the wider middle layer that allows the network to learn richer representations.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Feed Forward Network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ojitha/blog/master/assets/images/2025-07-23-LLMonAWS/ffn_sketch.svg)\n",
        "\n",
        "The key purpose is to introduce **non-linearity** into the model. While attention mechanisms perform linear operations (weighted sums), the FFN with its ReLU activation can learn complex, non-linear transformations. This allows the model to capture intricate relationships and patterns that linear operations alone cannot represent. The 4x expansion gives the network enough capacity to learn these complex functions before compressing the information back into the standard embedding size for the next layer.\n",

To troubleshoot this, you can perform a check to see if the DataFrame has any key variables by running the following code:\n\ndf.keys()\n\nIf a key variable is returned, you have likely introduced a key error via a column that does not have a key. If so, the following steps can be used to fix the key error:\n\n1. Identify the offending column:\n   - If the key exists and is a string, you can use the try_filter method to validate the string to make sure it exists in the key variable\n   - If the key exists and is a tuple, you can use the unique method to make sure the tuple is distinct and then use the dist function to see if it's in the key variable\n   - If the key variable does not contain any string, or tuple, then the DataFrame contains a no_keys DataType and you'll need to use a no_key method to create the missing value in the key variable\n\n2.
